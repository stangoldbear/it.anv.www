# Tasks: MDX Content Migration for Associazione Nuova Vita Website

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-a-gatsby/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/mdx-frontmatter-schema.yaml

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order: P1 stories (US1, US2, US4) ‚Üí P2 stories (US3, US5) ‚Üí P3 stories (US6, US7)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
- **Constitution Compliance (Phase 11)**: Depends on Polish phase completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 - Homepage (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 - Chi Siamo (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 - Servizi (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 - Donate (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 5 - 5x1000 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 6 - Diventa Socio (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 7 - Documenti (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires DocumentLink component (T075-T077)

### Within Each User Story

- Create MDX file with frontmatter first
- Migrate content from existing TSX file
- Add MDX components (Hero, Button, Card, DocumentLink)
- Verify page renders correctly
- Test accessibility and navigation
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All 3 tasks can run in parallel (different directories)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
  - T006, T007, T008 (CSS files) can run in parallel
  - T009, T010 (TypeScript types) can run in parallel
  - T020-T025 (Components and CSS) can be parallelized by component
- **Phase 3-9 (User Stories)**: Once Foundational completes, all 7 user stories can start in parallel if team capacity allows
- **Phase 10 (Polish)**: T082, T083, T085, T086, T088 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 11 (Constitution Compliance)**:
  - Performance audits (T099-T101) can run in parallel
  - SEO audits (T103, T104, T106) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase (Phase 2)

```bash
# Launch all CSS-related tasks together:
T006: "Create tokens.css with design tokens"
T007: "Create reset.css"
T008: "Update global.css to import tokens and reset"

# Launch all TypeScript type tasks together:
T009: "Create mdx.d.ts"
T010: "Create frontmatter.ts"

# Launch all component creation tasks together (by component):
T020 + T021: "Create Button.tsx and Button.module.css"
T022 + T023: "Create Hero.tsx and Hero.module.css"
T024 + T025: "Create Card.tsx and Card.module.css"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Stories (Phase 3-9)

```bash
# With multiple developers, after Foundational phase completes:
Developer A: Phase 3 (Homepage - US1)
Developer B: Phase 4 (Chi Siamo - US2)
Developer C: Phase 6 (Donate - US4)
Developer D: Phase 5 (Servizi - US3)

# Each story is independent and can be tested separately
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (P1 Stories Only)

**Goal**: Deliver core functionality with highest business value

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T027) - **CRITICAL - blocks all stories**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Homepage (T028-T034)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Chi Siamo (T035-T041)
5. Complete Phase 6: User Story 4 - Donate (T049-T056)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all P1 stories independently
7. Complete Phase 10: Polish (T082-T090)
8. Complete Phase 11: Constitution Compliance (T091-T115)
9. Deploy MVP with homepage, about, and donate pages

**MVP Task Count**: 3 (setup) + 24 (foundational) + 7 (US1) + 7 (US2) + 8 (US4) + 9 (polish) + 25 (compliance) = **83 tasks**

### Incremental Delivery (All Stories)

**Goal**: Add features incrementally after MVP

1. Complete MVP (83 tasks above)
2. Deploy/demo MVP
3. Add Phase 5: User Story 3 - Servizi (T042-T048) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
4. Add Phase 7: User Story 5 - 5x1000 (T057-T064) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
5. Add Phase 8: User Story 6 - Diventa Socio (T065-T072) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
6. Add Phase 9: User Story 7 - Documenti (T073-T081) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

**Full Task Count**: 83 (MVP) + 7 (US3) + 8 (US5) + 8 (US6) + 9 (US7) = **115 tasks**

### Parallel Team Strategy

**Goal**: Maximum velocity with multiple developers

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Phase 1: Setup together (3 tasks)
2. Team completes Phase 2: Foundational together with parallelization (24 tasks)
3. Once Foundational is done, split by priority:
   - **Developer A**: Phase 3 (Homepage - US1) - 7 tasks
   - **Developer B**: Phase 4 (Chi Siamo - US2) - 7 tasks
   - **Developer C**: Phase 6 (Donate - US4) - 8 tasks
4. After P1 stories complete:
   - **Developer A**: Phase 5 (Servizi - US3) - 7 tasks
   - **Developer B**: Phase 7 (5x1000 - US5) - 8 tasks
5. After P2 stories complete:
   - **Developer A**: Phase 8 (Diventa Socio - US6) - 8 tasks
   - **Developer B**: Phase 9 (Documenti - US7) - 9 tasks
6. Team completes Phase 10: Polish together (9 tasks)
7. Team completes Phase 11: Constitution Compliance together (25 tasks)

**Estimated Timeline**: With 3 developers, can complete in ~60% of sequential time

- **Phase 1**: 3 tasks can run in parallel
- **Phase 2**: Up to 10 tasks can run in parallel (CSS, types, components)
- **Phase 3-9**: All 7 user stories can run in parallel after Phase 2 (if team capacity allows)
- **Phase 10**: Up to 5 tasks can run in parallel
- **Phase 11**: Up to 6 tasks can run in parallel (audits)

**Total parallelizable tasks**: 47 tasks marked with [P]

## MVP Scope Recommendation

**Recommended MVP**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + US1 + US2 + US4 + Phase 10 + Phase 11

**Rationale**:
- **Homepage (US1)**: Essential entry point that communicates mission and guides visitors
- **Chi Siamo (US2)**: Builds trust and credibility for potential donors/volunteers
- **Donate (US4)**: Direct path to financial support, critical for non-profit operations
- **Skipped initially**:
  - Servizi (US3): Can be added post-launch without blocking core donation flow
  - 5x1000 (US5): Seasonal (tax season), can be added before tax filing period
  - Diventa Socio (US6): Membership is important but secondary to donations
  - Documenti (US7): Transparency is valuable but not blocking for initial launch

**MVP Timeline Estimate**:
- Sequential: 83 tasks √ó ~30 min avg = ~41 hours (~5 days for 1 developer)
- With 2 developers: ~60% = ~25 hours (~3 days)
- With 3 developers: ~50% = ~20 hours (~2.5 days)

**Post-MVP Additions** (in order):
1. Add US5 (5x1000) before tax season - 8 tasks
2. Add US3 (Servizi) to complete service information - 7 tasks
3. Add US6 (Diventa Socio) to build membership - 8 tasks
4. Add US7 (Documenti) for transparency - 9 tasks

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can be executed in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1-US7)
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- No test tasks included (not requested in spec.md)
- Commit after each task or logical group (e.g., component + CSS module)
- Stop at checkpoints to validate story independently
- All file paths are absolute paths from repository root
- Design tokens must be used (no magic numbers in CSS)
- All TypeScript must pass strict type checking
- All pages must meet WCAG AA accessibility standards
- All pages must achieve Lighthouse Performance ‚â• 90
